# Auto Slide

**Work in Progress**

Auto Slide is an open source camera rail used to take short moving clips or moving time lapses. While it is completely free to take these designs and make it yourself, eventually parts can be ordered as needed and the money spent will be used to help fund the project (more information coming soon). 
The rail is designed to be mostly 3D printed and fairly cheap. Other than the PCB and 3D printed parts, the rest of the materials can be bought off of Amazon (more information coming soon). If someone would buy a full kit, it would come with everything except the rail (pipes). Those can be bought at any hardware store and the belt can be trimmed to fit any length of pipe under 6ft. 

At some point, insructions on how to build and piece together the rail as well as how to use the software to program the rail.
